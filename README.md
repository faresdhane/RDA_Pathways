# RDA Plenary Pathways
The project aims to match Research Data Alliance groups and their outputs to specific pathways.This is achieved through data collection, text mining, and machine learning techniques such as classification or clustering algorithms. The methodology ensures accuracy and efficiency in the process and helps to achieve the objective of better decision-making and strategic planning for the organization.

Machine learning classification and clustering algorithms were employed to map RDA groups, recommendations and outputs, to the Plenary pathways. A text mining exercise was undertaken to assign a list of specific keywords to each Plenary pathway using session application texts submitted by groups in 2019, 2020, and 2021. Group charters and case statement texts, harvested from the RDA website, were mined for these keywords to map groups to the Plenary pathways. The reported pathways of some groups were also considered to assess the accuracy of the matching process and make necessary adjustments.
Similarly, recommendations and output texts, harvested from the RDA website and Zenodo, were mined for these keywords to map recommendations and outputs to the Plenary pathways. Not all groups, recommendations and outputs were mapped to a Plenary pathway. The data and code generated and analysed are available on this GitHub repository.
