# RDA_Pathways
The project aims to match Research Data Alliance groups and their outputs to specific pathways.This is achieved through data collection, text mining, and machine learning techniques such as classification or clustering algorithms. The methodology ensures accuracy and efficiency in the process and helps to achieve the objective of better decision-making and strategic planning for the organization.

The goal of the project is to match Research Data Alliance (RDA) groups and their outputs to specific pathways. The methodology for achieving this involves collecting data such as the charter and case of statement for each RDA group, as well as the outputs and pathways. Text mining is performed on this data to extract the most specific and commonly used words that describe the groups, outputs, and pathways. The top five words that best describe each group and output are selected, and the most specific words that describe the pathways are extracted from the 2020 and 2019 plenaries submissions per group.

To assess the accuracy of the matching, the groups and outputs that are already listed per pathway are compared to the matched groups and outputs.
