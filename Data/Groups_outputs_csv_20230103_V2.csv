As part of the Education And Training On Handling Of Research Data IG activities, the Minimal Metadata for Learning Resources Focus Group recommends a minimal set of metadata for learning resources. By comparing and analyzing existing learning resource-related metadata schemas to find the overlaps, the group provides guidance on metadata elements that should be minimally required for purposes of learning resource discovery to those concerned with supporting or providing training resources.  This set includes a report, a list of minimal metadata elements along with a data dictionary with examples for how to use the elements, and supporting documents.

As part of the Education And Training On Handling Of Research Data IG (ETHRD-IG) activities, the Learning Resource Collectors Focus Group studied the evolving landscape of learning resources on RDM topics. As we collected and listed a snapshot of current catalogues or registries of learning resources for review, we realized that a set of core characteristics could describe these types of organisations that would be useful to help people evaluate and understand the resources they offer. In addition, the identification of core characteristics could help the organisations themselves consider some of the factors that might help them build, structure, and sustain their collections and the services they offer in support of researchers and data specialists seeking learning resources on RDM and data skills topics. This document also supports the work of another ETHRD-IG focus group that recommends a set of minimal metadata elements for learning resources.

Despite the importance of collections, many are not maintained or curated as thoroughly as they should. Part of the reason for this is the lack of professional reward for curation, maintenance, or collection. To address this gap in attribution metadata, this Working Group recommends the use of PROV entities and properties to link people (Agent), the curatorial actions they perform (Activity), and the digital or physical objects they are curating (Entity). Assigning a Role to an Agent is optional. These recommendations are discussed in the context of the RDA and existing standards.

Sustainable Business Models for Brokering Middleware to support Research Interoperability,Brokering Governance WG,"Stefano Nativi, Max Craglia, Jay Pearlman",Historical Group,NA,Recommendations with RDA Endorsement in Process,NA,NA,"


The Brokering Governance Recommendation discusses the strengths and weakness of different models in the context of long-term sustainment of brokering middleware. Examination of alternatives leads to a prioritization among models with the recognition that no single model by itself is likely to provide the desired sustainment. The analysis suggests that a hybridized model incorporating aspects of three different business models over the lifespan of the brokering middleware, i.e. federally funded data facility guardianship in the establishment stage replaced or supported by a Consortium model and/or Software-as-a- Service as the broker matures, will likely provide the strongest model for sustainment.

A set of hubs will collect literature­data (as well as data­data) links from their natural communities using minor extensions to existing local procedures and, in some cases, inference. The hubs agree on an interoperability framework with a common information model and open exchange methods, optimised for exchanging information among the hubs. The hubs will serve as an enabling global information infrastructure for the development of (third party) services.
The Recommendation is also published at the following DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.15497/RDA00002
Relevant to this recommendation is also the release of the Scholix framework by ICSU-WDS and RDA, details can be found here: https://rd-alliance.org/rda-and-icsu-wds-announce-scholix-framework-link...

These procedures are intended to support the implementation of the Catalogue of Common Requirements developed by the WG to harmonize the certification criteria previously established by the DSA and ICSU-­WDS.
